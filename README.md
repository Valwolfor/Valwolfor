Hello,

I am a *psychologist* passionate about technology and software development. Throughout my career, I have explored various areas of computing, from web application development to mobile programming ðŸ“±.

My experience includes working with technologies such as **Java** (including Spring Boot and Java EE), **Dart** and Flutter for mobile development, as well as **JavaScript** (JS) and **TypeScript** (TS) for web applications with **Python** for the backend. In working on different group projects in both tech and non-tech contexts. Applying the principles of OOP, SOLID, and Agile practices.

Mastery of relational databases like Postgres, MySQL, and non-relational with MongoDB and documentary with Firebase. Also in Linux SO and network configurations. 

In addition to my interest in technology, I am fascinated by the world of cybersecurity and am constantly looking for ways to improve online security and 
protect user privacy.

I'm excited to continue learning and collaborating on new and challenging projects!

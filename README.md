My experience includes working with technologies such as **Java** (including Spring Boot and Java EE), **Dart** and Flutter for mobile development, as well as **JavaScript** (JS) and **TypeScript** (TS) for web applications with **Python** for the backend. In working on different group projects in both tech and non-tech contexts. Applying the principles of OOP, SOLID, cybersecurity, introducing in AI and Agile practices.

Mastery of relational databases like Postgres, MySQL, and non-relational with MongoDB and documentary with Firebase. Also in Linux SO and network configurations. 

In addition to my interest in technology, I am fascinated by the world of cybersecurity and am constantly looking for ways to improve online security and
